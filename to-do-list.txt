- [] Create list with all country sample designs.

Stefan: I told you about the `intsvy` package to deal with surveys such as PISA. Install the package `intsvy` and checkout for example
`intsvy::pisa_conf`. They save all the sampling related variables in a list for each survey. Another example is  `intsvy::pirls_conf`
for the PIRLS survey. I think we could do something similar but for each country. For example, create a list called `ger` for Germany
that will contain one slot for year 2006 and inside that slot it contains the variable names needed for creating the sampling design.
The nice thing is that each country could potentially have all years (2008, etc..) at some point and all variables for every single year.
Of couse this is a lot work, perhaps there's a way of scraping this from the ESS or some PDF.

- [] Define sampling design for chosen country
- [] Estimate the covariance matrix using the survey package and the sampling design objects defined for country and round
- [] Adjust the estimated covariance matrix with the `sqpr` estimates
- [] Run regressions using the lavaan package and suppling the corrected covariance matrix estimated and the variance of the covariance matrix

- [] if we have time, ‘hack’ the lavaan.survey function by adding the `sqpr` corrections
